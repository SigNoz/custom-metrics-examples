### How to run the example
```
npm install
node app.js
```
This will start a webapp in local host with a `Hello World` message. Refresh this page multiple times 
to send metrics to SigNoz backend

This will send metrics
`requests_count_total` and `metric_name_test_total` to SigNoz backend

You can visualise them by creating custom dashboards
